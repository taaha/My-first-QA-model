# My-first-QA-model

In this NLP exercise we develop a simple reader QA model (answers questions based on context) based on the popular Squad dataset from stanford.

Project contains the following notebooks

### Notebook 1 and 1.1
We download the squad train and test validation dataset and save it after cleaning it

### Notebook 2
We download and use a BERT model pre-trained on squad dataset. 
Using this model we create our QA pipeline

### Notebook 3
To evaluate our model we need metrics. We explore the Exact Match (EM) metric and its limitations

### Notebook 4
We explore a better metric, the ROGUE metric

### Notebook 5
Finally, we evaluate our model on the ROGUE metric
